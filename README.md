Developer MultiGroup Ã‡ekiliÅŸ ArkadaÅŸÄ±n is a web application for managing and organizing team giveaways, promoting engagement and fun within teams! There is a stage logic which is determined before the giveaway starts, so that every level unlocks in the specified time.

## How to Play

1. Login / Register with Supabase Auth
2. **Stage-1:** Choose the person which you will buy a present to using a giveaway spinner.
3. **Stage-2:** Upload the present you have bought to the system when the stage unlocks.
4. **Stage-3:** Play a game of **_Who Bought This Present ?_** as the last stage, don't forget to check your score from the scoreboard page for more surprises :)

## Technologies

- Next.js: Used for both frontend and backend development of the site.
- Vercel: For deployment of the project to the web.
- Supabase: Preference of provider for user authentication and database management.
- Tailwind CSS: Utility-first CSS framework for responsive and customizable UI.

## Run Locally

### Getting Started

### Supabase Integration

We are using Supabase as our main storage - database - authentication provider for this project, so you firstly should [create an account](https://supabase.com/dashboard/sign-up).

#### Project Creation

As the first step after creating account, we need to create an organization which will hold your project

![create_org](public/images/documentation/create_org.png)

and a project which will hold your data (storage - db - auth),

![create_project](public/images/documentation/create_project.png)

#### Database Creation

Now you are ready to create the tables that will hold your user data, matches and present photo URL's. Here is the schema for the database tables:

![db_schema](public/images/documentation/db-schema.png)

To create these tables, you can directly copy and paste the following query to SQL Editor which can be found in your sidebar:

```postgresql
-- Hold the user related calues
create table users (
    id uuid primary key default uuid_generate_v4(), -- Current User ID
    name text, -- Name of the current user
    surname text, -- Surname of the current user
    photo_url text, -- Public URL to users profile picture
    points int4, -- Points gained from the game stage
    username text, -- Username of the current user
    email text, -- E-Mail of the current user
    has_match bool, -- Whether someone has this user as a match in the mathces table
    game_played bool -- Whether the user has played the game already
);

-- Matches tablosu
create table matches (
    id uuid primary key default uuid_generate_v4(), -- Current User ID
    matched_to text -- ID of the matched user
);

-- Presents tablosu
create table presents (
    id text primary key, -- Current User ID
    photo_url text -- Public URL to the photo of the present this user has bought
);
```

#### Storage Creation

Supabase Storage will hold our user's profile pictures and the photos of the presents they have bought, so we need to initialize a storage bucket named `images` and some sub-folders inside that storage bucket with names `presents` and `users`. You can access storage bucket creation in your sidebar's

```sh
ðŸ“‚ images /
â”œâ”€â”€ ðŸ“‚ presents/
â””â”€â”€ ðŸ“‚ users/
```

It is enough for you to create the directories correctly, the application will handle the rest of the work.

#### Disable Authentication E-Mails

If you don't want your recently registered users to get an automatic e-mail from Supabase Auth for E-Mail verification, you can toggle the following setting in the Authentication tab of your sidebar:

![disable_verification](public/images/documentation/disable_verify.png)

### Environment Variables

You only need two environment variables to run the project correctly, your Supabase URL and Supabase Key. You can get this values from the following page:

![environment_variables](public/images/documentation/env_variables.png)

After getting these values, (assuming you already forked and cloned this project to your local machine, if not check out [run the project section](#run-the-project)) create a `.env` file at the root of your project and populate it like the following:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_KEY=your_supabase_key
```

### Run the Project

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone the repository to your local machine.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/repository-name.git
   cd repository-name
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**: Install the required dependencies.

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start the Development Server**: Run the project in development mode.
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## Customizing

### Organization Identity

You can change the background and logos both on the user form and loading screen easily, you only need to change the contents of the [following folder](https://github.com/Developer-MultiGroup/cekilis-arkadasi/tree/main/public/images/constants) while keeping the file names as they are.

```sh
ðŸ“‚ public /
â””â”€â”€ ðŸ“‚ images/
    â””â”€â”€ ðŸ“‚ constants/
        â”œâ”€â”€ background.png
        â”œâ”€â”€ loading_logo.png
        â””â”€â”€ logo.png
```

### Stages

To change the look, title or time of a stage you can simply edit the [stages array](https://github.com/Developer-MultiGroup/cekilis-arkadasi/blob/main/src/data/stages.ts) in the following directory

```sh
ðŸ“‚ src /
â””â”€â”€ ðŸ“‚ data/
    â””â”€â”€ stages.ts
```

Example Stage Object:

```ts
{
    "index": 1, // Takes values 1, 2 and 3
    "name": "EÅŸleÅŸme", // name of the stage displayed on StageCard component
    "start_date": "2024-12-15T22:30:00+03:00", // Determines when the stage unlocks, accepts any time-zone in this format
    "image": "/images/stages/1.png" // Path to the stage image shown on StageCard component
}
```

You don't need to edit the source URL for the stage image, rather you can just upload a new image with the same name to the [following directory](https://github.com/Developer-MultiGroup/cekilis-arkadasi/tree/main/public/images/stages), as in the [organization identity](#organization-identity) section above.

```sh
ðŸ“‚ public /
â””â”€â”€ ðŸ“‚ images/
    â””â”€â”€ ðŸ“‚ stages/
        â”œâ”€â”€ 1.png
        â”œâ”€â”€ 2.png
        â””â”€â”€ 3.png
```
