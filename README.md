# DMG Ã‡ekiliÅŸ ArkadaÅŸÄ±n

Developer MultiGroup Ã‡ekiliÅŸ ArkadaÅŸÄ±n is a project developed to use in giveaways of any kind. Users log in and choose the person they are going to buy a present to using a giveaway spinner. After that users upload the presents they have bought and play a game of "Who bought this present?" as the last step.

## Technologies

- Next.js: Used for both frontend and backend development of the site.
- Vercel: For deployment of the project to the web.
- Supabase: Preference of provider for user authentication and database management.
- Tailwind CSS: Utility-first CSS framework for responsive and customizable UI.

### Getting Started

### Supabase Integration

We are using Supabase as our main storage - database - authentication provider for this project, so you firstly should [create an account](https://supabase.com/dashboard/sign-up)

#### Project Creation

As a first step we need to create an organization which will hold our project

![create_org](public/images/documentation/create_org.png)

and a project which will hold your data (storage - db - auth),

![create_project](public/images/documentation/create_project.png)

#### Database Creation

Now you are ready to create the tables that will hold your user data, matches and present photo URL's. Here is the schema for the database tables:

![db_schema](public/images/documentation/db-schema.png)

To create these tables, you can directly copy and paste the following query to SQL Editor which can be found in your sidebar:

```postgresql
-- Hold the user related calues
create table users (
    id uuid primary key default uuid_generate_v4(), -- Current User ID
    name text, -- Name of the current user
    surname text, -- Surname of the current user
    photo_url text, -- Public URL to users profile picture
    points int4, -- Points gained from the game stage
    username text, -- Username of the current user
    email text, -- E-Mail of the current user
    has_match bool, -- Whether someone has this user as a match in the mathces table
    game_played bool -- Whether the user has played the game already
);

-- Matches tablosu
create table matches (
    id uuid primary key default uuid_generate_v4(), -- Current User ID
    matched_to text -- ID of the matched user
);

-- Presents tablosu
create table presents (
    id text primary key, -- Current User ID
    photo_url text -- Public URL to the photo of the present this user has bought
);
```

#### Storage Creation

Supabase Storage will hold our user's profile pictures and the photos of the presents they have bought, so we need to initialize a storage bucket named `images` and some sub-folders inside that storage bucket with names `presents` and `users`. You can access storage bucket creation in your sidebar's

```sh
ðŸ“‚ images /
â”œâ”€â”€ ðŸ“‚ presents/
â””â”€â”€ ðŸ“‚ users/
```

It is enough for you to create the directories correctly, the application will handle the rest of the work.

#### Disable Authentication E-Mails

If you don't want your recently registered users to get an automatic e-mail from Supabase Auth for E-Mail verification, you can toggle the following setting in the Authentication tab of your sidebar:

![disable_verification](public/images/documentation/disable_verify.png)

### Environment Variables

You only need two environment variables to run the project correctly, your Supabase URL and Supabase Key. You can get this values from the following page:

![environment_variables](public/images/documentation/env_variables.png)

After getting these values, (assuming you already forked and cloned this project to your local machine, if not check out [run the project section](#run-the-project) create a `.env` file at the root of your project and populate it like the following:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_KEY=your_supabase_key
```
